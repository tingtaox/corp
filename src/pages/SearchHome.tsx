          WHEN TIMOTHY EVANS, Andrew Mark Settles, James Titus, and John Kennard touched down at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, they looked a little pale. The four men had just spent 45 days voyaging millions of miles through the galaxy to collect soil samples from a near-earth asteroid. Yet, they hadn't been to space. Instead, they'd simulated a fake mission inside the Human Exploration Research Analog, a 636-square-foot metal capsule that helps NASA understand how humans behave when cooped up in a spacecraft for so long.

          I've never done this. Is that really true?

          Space may be infinite, but spaceships are kinda small. No one would blame you for feeling a little irritable after being trapped inside a 300-cubic foot metal capsule for days, though it might be a problem if you start picking fights with the crew, or stop communicating with ground control, or abort the mission completely. To minimize the risks, scientists have been studying the psychological effects of space travel for years, but NASA only began simulations inside the HERA in 2014.

          Photographer Cassandra Klos visited the HERA in June, catching the end of the first mission of the program's fourth campaign; her cinematic images let viewers relive the experience. “I want this work to be a portal for the audience—to allow them to step into this fiction, this simulation, this virtual reality,” Klos says.
